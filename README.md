# Aktiva üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Aktiva** is a modern React web app built for a new gym based in Toronto, designed and developed from the ground up to energize users and reflect a bold, active brand.
I took this project from zero to launch ‚Äî owning the full process of designing, developing, and deploying a seamless user experience that captures the gym‚Äôs brand energy and drives membership sign-ups.
